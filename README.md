Style-guide-view-source
=======================

style-guide-view-source is a simple jQuery script to show the expected source code in a .html file. For example an Style guide boilerplate. 

It uses [prism js](http://prismjs.com/) to do the syntax highlightning.

## Short description
Each block you want to show the source code of should be wrapped in a 
```html
<div class="style-section-code"></div>
```

The script then iterate over the sections and adds markup and a 'Show code' button.

Press the button and tada! Pretty code appears.
